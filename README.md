# Volume-Gesture
# This project processes frames taken from your video capture camera and uses frames
# to try and detect a hand in order to draw landmarks on the hand.
# It then sets a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100, and based on the distance between
# the index finger and the thumb, it will adjust the volume of the computer accordingly.
